# Dungeon Generator

## About

This is a project for University of Helsinki Data Structure Lab course. In this project, there are two different dungeon generation algorithms - cellular automaton and random walk - and two different flood fill algorithms - forest fire and scan line.

Below are a few images of what kind of dungeons can be created with the two different algorithms. The dungeons are numbered, and the used algorithms and parameters are

1. Cellular automaton; dimensions: 100x100; iterations: 4; stone percent: 40%
2. Cellular automaton; dimensions: 100x100; iterations: 4; stone percent: 45%
3. Cellular automaton; dimensions: 100x100; iterations: 4; stone percent: 52%
4. Random walk; dimensions: 100x100; chance of spawning a new walker: 2%; dig percent: 45%; no complex walk
5. Random walk; dimensions: 100x100; chance of spawning a new walker: 10%; dig percent: 60%; no complex walk
6. Random walk; dimensions: 100x100; chance of spawning a new walker: 5%; dig percent: 30%; complex walk; chance of turning: 60%
