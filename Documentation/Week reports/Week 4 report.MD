# Week 4 report

Work hours: 10-15 h

This week I started by creating a new method for flood fill; now it finds the largest connected area and fills everything else with stone. This makes it so the finished dungeon is a single connected area.

Following that I created new unit tests and performance test option when running, updated the GUI, and refactored code to be easier to read. Then I started work on implementation and testing documents.
