# Week 1 report

This week, I started early by figuring out my subject. I soon decided upon dungeon generation because of my interest in procedural generation.

I started by researching about different kinds of dungeon and maze generation algorithms. This proved to be time-consuming and I used somewhere up to 10 hours simply reading articles, watching videos on YouTube, and looking at people's code in GitHub. Ultimately, I decided upon cellular automata and random walk algorithms.

Next up, I spent hours researching different ways of implementing the two algorithms and different rule sets for both.

Following that, I contacted the teacher about the project, and was told to also implement a pathfinding algorithm for the dungeons. For this, I ended up choosing flood fill simply because I plan on creating sprawling cave-like structures with the generation algorithms, so flood fill seemed the most suitable for the job.

After finally getting the scope of the project together, I wrote the specification document and coded a rough version of the cellular automaton. There seems to be some logical faults in it, but I didn't have time to properly look through it.

All in all, I'd say that the project took at least 20 hours of my time this week.
