# Week 5 report

Work hours: 12-15 h

This week, I first decided to add another flood fill algorithm (I call it scan fill) to the project because I had time and I thought it would improve the quality of the project since now we can compare the performance of the two flood fill algorithms with one another. Of course, for that, I created performance tests for the flood fill algorithms by creating test "dungeons" (you can read about these in the testing document).

Lastly, I created more unit tests, improved the GUI, cleaned the GUI code, and updated the documentation.
